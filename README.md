# ouija

## about
ouija is a communicator web-app which you can host completely by yourself using docker. the app runs on PostgreSQL (it is not suitable for very high traffic loads), Redis and Next.js. 

one of our goals is making a basic but reliable e2ee, which allows users to communicate privately.

## installing
`git clone`

`docker compose up`

idk somehow like that

## how to start?
run the docker container using the command:

`abc`

and then access the site via `localhost:3000`
